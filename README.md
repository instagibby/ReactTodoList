# First React App
After doing the React, Redux and then React / Redux Free Code Camp courses I made a simple todo list. It is not much, but I go onto further develop a todo list over on my [React-Redux repo](https://github.com/instagibby/React-Redux) where I make something a little more complex using redux as well.
